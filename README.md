# Planitor

Planning + Monitoring = Planitor

A business intelligence service for people in the planning, property, transport and construction sector in
Iceland.

# High level

There are two development servers, for bundling frontend and the backend respectively.

# Development

You will need Python Poetry, Yarn and Postgres.

```bash
createuser planitor
createdb -O planitor planitor
createdb -O planitor planitor_test
```

Configure .env in the project root

Install dependencies

```bash
yarn install
poetry install
```

Run server

```bash
poetry run uvicorn planitor.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000 --reload
```

Run frontend

```bash
yarn run watch
```

Preparing deployment

```bash
NODE_ENV=production yarn run build  # frontend build
poetry export -f requirements.txt > requirements.txt
```

Then commit this to repo and push to GitHub. Render takes over from there.

Deploy scrapers â€” beautifulsoup4 needs to be added manually

```bash
poetry export -f requirements.txt --without-hashes > scrapy-requirements.txt
echo "beautifulsoup4==4.8.2\nhtml5lib==1.0.1" >> scrapy-requirements.txt
poetry run shub deploy
```
